## Sydney Informatics Hub

The [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/sydney-informatics-hub) is a Core Research Facility of [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). We work towards enabling excellence in data and compute intensive research. We are:

- 👩‍💻 Data scientists and Machine learning engineers 🤖
- 🧬 Bioinformaticians 🧬
- 🖥️ High performance computing experts ☁️
- 👨‍💻 Software engineers 👩‍💻
- :heavy_division_sign: Statisticians :heavy_multiplication_x:

We provide support, training, and expertise in statistics, data science, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, software engineering, simulation, visualisation, and research computing.

We've:

- Created [reusable workflows for bioinformatics](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Bioinformatics) on Australia's national supercompute resources & commercial cloud, as an official node of [Australian BioCommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) 🔬 🧬
- Advised thousands of higher degree by research students on how to use statistics to best achieve their research objectives. :heavy_division_sign: :heavy_multiplication_x:
- Built an [open-source platform for plant images in agricultural crops](https://weed-ai.sydney.edu.au/) to support robotic weed-killing using AI 🌱🤖 🧑‍🌾
- Created text analysis tools for Digital Humanities researchers through the [Australian Text Analytics Platform](https://www.atap.edu.au/) and the [Language Data Commons of Australia](https://www.ldaca.edu.au/)
- Developed state-of-the-art open-source visual AI models for [detecting and identifying native australian wildlife in camera trap images](https://marsupial.ai/) 📸 🦊 🐨
- [Created a tool to collect geospatial data easily]([https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/AgReFed-DataHarvester/](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/geodata-harvester/)) ([demo app here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SIH/geodata-harvester-app)), and then [build spatio-temporal models on it](https://www.agrefed.org.au/cb_pages/agrefed_mechanistic_and_data-driven_models.php) so that farmers can make better decisions 🛰️🌱 👨🏿‍🌾
- Engineered a [radio-astronomy pipeline to detect variable and slow transient light sources](https://www.vast-survey.org/vast-pipeline/) using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder 📡 🌞 🌌
- Optimised code for simulating plate tectonics, to better understand how our Earth forms! 🌏 🌋 
- Used machine learning models and echocardiogram data to improve cardiology diagnostics 🩺 🩻 🏩
- Put up freely available [Statistical resources and training materials](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/stats-resources/workshops_and_workflows.html) 📚🏛️
- Helped researchers at the University of Sydney with accessing and running their code on our supercomputer Artemis, with over 191 million CPU hours or 21,000 CPU years of compute run over the last 6 years.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Find out more about the many ways we have enabled research and the exciting things we are working on at our website.
