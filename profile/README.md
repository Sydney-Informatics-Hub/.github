## Sydney Informatics Hub

The [Sydney Informatics Hub](https://www.sydney.edu.au/sydney-informatics-hub) is a Core Research Facility of [The University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/). We work towards enabling excellence in data and compute intensive research. We are:

- 👩‍💻 Data scientists and Machine learning engineers 🤖
- 🧬 Bioinformaticians 🧬
- 🖥️ High performance computing experts ☁️
- 👨‍💻 Software engineers 👩‍💻
- :heavy_division_sign: Statisticians :heavy_multiplication_x:

We provide support, training, and expertise in statistics, data science, artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, software engineering, simulation, visualisation, and research computing.

We've:

- Created [reusable workflows for bioinformatics](https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/Bioinformatics) on Australia's national supercompute resources & commercial cloud, as an official node of the [Australian Biocommons](https://www.biocommons.org.au/) 🔬 🧬
- Built an [open-source platform for plant images in agricultural crops](https://weed-ai.sydney.edu.au/) to support robotic weed-killing using AI 🌱🤖 🧑‍🌾
- Created text analysis tools for Digital Humanities researchers through the [Australian Text Analytics Platform](https://www.atap.edu.au/) and the [Language Data Commons of Australia](https://www.ldaca.edu.au/)
- Developed state-of-the-art open-source visual AI models for [detecting and identifying native australian wildlife in camera trap images](https://marsupial.ai/) 📸 🦊 🐨
- [Created a tool to collect geospatial data easily]([https://github.com/Sydney-Informatics-Hub/AgReFed-DataHarvester/](https://sydney-informatics-hub.github.io/geodata-harvester/)) ([demo app here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/SIH/geodata-harvester-app)), and then [build spatio-temporal models on it](https://www.agrefed.org.au/cb_pages/agrefed_mechanistic_and_data-driven_models.php) so that farmers can make better decisions 🛰️🌱 👨🏿‍🌾
- Engineered a [radio-astronomy pipeline to detect variable and slow transient light sources](https://www.vast-survey.org/vast-pipeline/) using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder 📡 🌞 🌌
- Optimised code for simulating plate tectonics, to better understand how our Earth forms! 🌏 🌋 
- Used machine learning models and echocardiogram data to improve cardiology diagnostics 🩺 🩻 🏩 

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Find out more about the many ways we have enabled research and the exciting things we are working on at our website & public facing GitHub.
