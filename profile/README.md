## Sydney Informatics Hub

A Core Research Facility of The University of Sydney.

We are:

- 👩‍💻 Data scientists 👨‍💻
- 👨‍💻 Software engineers 👩‍💻
- 🧬 Bioinformaticians 🧬
- 🖥️ High performance computing experts ☁️
- 🤖 Machine learning engineers 🤖

And together we work towards

## *Enabling excellence in data and compute intensive research*

We provide support, training, and expertise in research data management, statistics, data science, software engineering, simulation, visualisation, bioinformatics, and research computing.

We've:

- Built an open source platform for annotated plant images to support the democratisation of visual AI in the agricultural industry 🌱🤖 🧑‍🌾 
- Developed state of the art open source visual AI models for detecting and identifying wildlife in camera trap images 📸 🦊 🐨
- Created reusable workflows for bioinformatics on Australia's national supercompute resources & commercial cloud 🔬 🧬 
- Optimised code for simulating plate tectonics, to better understand how our Earth forms! 🌏 🌋 
- Used machine learning models and echocardiogram data to improve cardiology diagnostics 🩺 🩻 🏩 
- Collaborated with the Australian Institute of Criminology to detect changepoints in organised criminal behabiour in response to changes in legislation 👮‍♂️ 🕵️‍♀️ 🏍️
- Modelled so many different soil attributes at high spatial resolution, so that farmers can make better decisions 🛰️🌱 👨🏿‍🌾
- Engineered a pipeline enabling radioastronomers to detect variables and slow transients using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder 📡 🌞 🌌

And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Find out more about the many ways we have enabled research and the exciting things we are working on at our website & public facing GitHub.
